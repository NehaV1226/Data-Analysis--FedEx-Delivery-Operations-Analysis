# Data-Analysis--FedEx-Delivery-Operations-Analysis
This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focuses on uncovering insights from FedEx Logistics' global supply chain dataset. The dataset encompasses detailed information on various aspects of logistics operations, including purchase orders (POs), shipment methods, vendor agreements (INCO terms), delivery schedules, and product-level data such as item descriptions and dosage forms. Given the complexity and scale of international logistics, the primary objective of this EDA is to support FedEx in enhancing supply chain efficiency, reducing operational costs, and ensuring timely deliveries.
